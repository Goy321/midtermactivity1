        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>League of Legends (LoL), commonly referred to as League, is a 2009 multiplayer online battle arena video
            game developed and published by Riot Games. Inspired by Defense of the Ancients, a custom map for Warcraft
            III, Riot's founders sought to develop a stand-alone game in the same genre. Since its release in October
            2009, League has been free-to-play and is monetized through purchasable character customization. The game is
            available for Microsoft Windows and macOS.<br><br>

            In the game, two teams of five players battle in player-versus-player combat, each team occupying and
            defending their half of the map. Each of the ten players controls a character, known as a "champion", with
            unique abilities and differing styles of play. During a match, champions become more powerful by collecting
            experience points, earning gold, and purchasing items to defeat the opposing team. In League's main mode,
            Summoner's Rift, a team wins by pushing through to the enemy base and destroying their "Nexus", a large
            structure located within.<br><br>

            League of Legends has received generally positive reviews; critics highlighted its accessibility, character
            designs, and production value. The game's long lifespan has resulted in a critical reappraisal, with reviews
            trending positively; the negative and abusive in-game behavior of its players, criticized since early in the
            game's lifetime, persists despite Riot's attempts to fix the problem. In 2019, League regularly peaked at
            eight million concurrent players, and its popularity has led to tie-ins such as music videos, comic books,
            short stories, and the animated series Arcane. Its success has also spawned several spin-off video games,
            including a mobile version, a digital collectible card game and a turn-based role-playing game, among
            others. A massively multiplayer online role-playing game based on the property is in development.
            <br><br>
            Regularly cited as the world's largest esport, the game has an international competitive scene consisting of
            multiple regional leagues. They culminate in the annual League of Legends World Championship. The 2019 event
            registered over 100 million unique viewers, peaking at a concurrent viewership of 44 million during the
            finals. Domestic and international events have been broadcast on livestreaming websites such as Twitch,
            YouTube, Bilibili, and on cable television sports channel ESPN.</p>
